MDEF is both a theoretical and practical Master. It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges. The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times. Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging. The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture. Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty. The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.","title":"Main"},{"location":"#the-design-for-emergent-futures-approach","text":"Welcome to the Mdef Library where you will be finding all the information of the Master programs throughout the years.

Come join us for a week of research activities in a unique location that will offer us a diversity of opportunities to experiment , learn and reflect about ecosystemic regeneration and striving for resilience through interdependent practices of knowing, intuition, material-driven experimentation, situational awareness and embodied research. ****Goals and Methodology**** \u00b6 After taking the first steps in the MDEF methodology, we open a parenthesis in the masters\u2019 program to connect to a very unique landscape and ecosystem in the Island of El Hierro to reflect and put into practice some of the ideas, topics and techniques we have shared during our first year of the course. Through exploratory visits , material experiments and reflection sessions , participants will get the chance to learn profound techniques of working in-between living ecosystems in a unique island context where striving for resilience and respect for the environment has become paramount in the last couple of decades. ****Sneak peek into the program**** \u00b6 We will explore ecosystemic thinking, increasing personal presence, conscience and consciousness and how to nurture these connections with nature as co-client. We will understand a slow and ancient wisdom alongside technological advancements. We will delve into how to bring happiness to communities, building of sustainable co-operatives, empowerment, water, mobility, data, tourism, organic farming, carbon sequestration and housing. We will learn examples of creating a more resilient economy centred on happiness and resilience. This workshop will offer a diversity of opportunities to Experiment, Learn and Reflect about yourself alongside ecosystemic regeneration and striving for resilience through interdependent practices of knowing, intuition, material-driven experimentation, situational awareness and embodied research. In parallel to the discovery of the island, we will have dedicated time and space for some reflective sessions to give shape to our collective learnings and intelligence. Through visits around the topics of energy production, sustainable agriculture, food production, ecological co-habitation and local architecture we will be discovering how el Hierro maintains and is developing new models of sustainability.

Track \u00b6 Reflection Faculty \u00b6 HOLON - Markel Cormenzana, Merce Rua When \u00b6 From the 22rd to the 25 th of November of 4 classes with a duration of 3 hours Syllabus & Schedule Design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. Evolving from an utilitarian perspective at the service of industry (design over) to the integration of the perspective of the human user and it\u2019s needs (design for) and, later on, it\u2019s integration as an active agent in the design process (design with) the agency and expertise of the designer has been critically put into question generation after generation. Presencing the burst of the user-centered bubble and in the face of various existential risks, along these sessions, we will inquire over our role as designers and experience what it means to design within creative communities with the goal of putting our personal projects and capacities at the service of deep transitions. Community engagement in practice - learning from Fab Lab Barcelona\u2019s projects \u00b6 Syllabus and Learning Objectives \u00b6 Those promoting participatory action-research believe that people have a universal right to participate in the production of knowledge which is a disciplined process of personal and social transformation. In this process, people rupture their existing attitudes of silence, accommodation and passivity, and gain confidence and abilities to alter unjust conditions and structures'. (Paulo Freire, in Smith et al, 1997:xi) Fab Lab Barcelona has been involved in many European and local action-research projects with the goal of developing, testing, and implementing alternative and circular strategies towards a (more) locally productive and globally connected city. In the practical sections of the Community Engagement seminar, MDEF students will be invited to explore methodologies and tools of two community-based local pilots led by Fab Lab Barcelona. The local pilots connected to the SISCODE and CENTRINNO EU projects, while differing in specific objectives and goals, have been aligned with the Fab City principles and share a common objective: both expand the purpose of creative spaces and practitioners to transform communities, societies and ecosystems, supporting the development of new approaches to innovation, learning and impact at the local level, while articulating global efforts. Within the context of the above-mentioned projects, during the two sessions, students will practice with methods to support social change whilst focussing down on the purpose of engagement. By learning and understanding the application of tailored tools and their practical uses, students will have access to knowledge and resources to use in their future projects. The pool of tools ranges from enabling actions to map actors and resources, analysing local contexts, identifying potential synergies and opportunities, and amplifying key benefits for local stakeholders. The practical course will be further enriched with thematic topics addressing circular and collaborative manufacturing, co-creation mechanisms, practice-based capacity building and peer-learning. During the two days of activities, students will also have the opportunity to visit and engage with four local community-driven projects in Poblenou. The visits will take place from 5pm to 7pm on November 22 nd and 24 th (TBC) and are aimed at learning about the projects\u2019 stories and achievements, their innovative strategies and approaches to inclusive and circular ecosystems.

From non-profit cooperatives, associations, and foundations transforming sectors such as housing or energy, to local SMEs exploring the circular economy, to programs of the United Nations working on eco-innovation or international corporations defining how sustainability fits companies of their size. We exist to help these organizations become the new normal through design. We work to align their organizational goals with the needs of the people they serve and their social and environmental context. From experiences to the ecosystem, we shape the everyday life of transitions. Merc\u00e8 Rua \u00b6 Merc\u00e8 Rua Farges is a researcher and design strategist at Holon.cat. With a multidisciplinary profile, at the crossroads between the social sciences, design, and the performing arts, she works to train and accompany organizations in their efforts to prosper by favoring a positive impact on society and the environment. Her passion is bringing people and teams together to bring out their collective intelligence and alignment to drive change. @merce.rua Email Address: merce@holon.cat Merkel Cormenzana \u00b6 Markel Cormenzana, Transition Designer.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources. When \u00b6 Every Monday Schedule \u00b6 03/10 Bootcamp Kick off - Pick your fight(s). \u00b6 Goals : Integrate personal and professional interests. Activity 1 : Pick your fight(s).

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown? Andersen was based at STEIM for 14 years, she was part of the Making Things Public art research program at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and lead the Instruments and Interfaces master\u2019s degree program at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague. She is a longstanding advisor of the Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie, and currently acts as expert reviewer for H2020, ICT and FET for both application and project reviews.

She currently works at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), teaching Design Processes for the Masters Digital Design (MSc.) program, as well as doing research with the Play and Civic Media research group. She is also a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie doctoral fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology and Philips Lighting Research. For over a decade her practise as a designer has investigated wearable technologies in art, research and commercial contexts. She has designed functional garments in a wide range of industries, from medical to commercial space flight, and lectures on the design challenges of integrating electronics into fashion. Most notably, she founded Vega Wearable Light, a line of illuminated outerwear for style-conscious cyclists from 2010-2014. Mackey's doctoral research focuses on explorations of digital materials combined with fashion and everyday clothing-wearing practices as a means of gaining insight into future smart-garment systems.

Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop) \u00b6 Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a \"forensic report\" of each artifact. Output: A written \"forensic report\". Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module. Output: A dataset Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop) \u00b6 Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing. Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows. Almost useless machines (Experience workshop) \u00b6 Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The Second Term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical). When \u00b6 Monday's Schedule \u00b6 09/01 Kick off - Reframing by reflecting on your project so far \u00b6 Goals: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals and next steps. Activity: Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 1 st trimester. Assignment: Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called \u201cfailures\u201d as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly. Deliverable: An updated version of your design space. A 500 word text with a summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project. Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1 st intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after). 16/01 Design Studio Reviews (individual) \u00b6 23/01 A 1PP Design intervention in context.

References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The Second Term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical).","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_2_2022_23/design_studio_term2_2022_23/#when","text":"Monday's","title":"When"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_2_2022_23/design_studio_term2_2022_23/#schedule","text":"","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_2_2022_23/design_studio_term2_2022_23/#0901-kick-off-reframing-by-reflecting-on-your-project-so-far","text":"Goals: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals and next steps.

The introduction of those processes into the design and industry fields are changing the paradigm on how we conceive the actual society and its production methods. This new mediation between the old knowledge and new techniques is making the process as important as the end work, all becoming a whole. During this 2 term course (2&3), students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through an unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources. Weekly Schedule \u00b6 Master Classes: \u00b6 This classes are given every two weeks on Wednesday and Thursdays from 10 Am to 13.00 Pm (CET time) for two weeks in a row. Lab life: \u00b6 In addition to the lectures, there are 2 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.Fabrication time through booking system,this happens every Tuesday and Friday Challenge week: \u00b6 Intensive timeframe for a week (Tuesday to Friday) where students will combine the knowledge gained in the previous classes. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of DIGITAL PROTOTYPING FOR DESIGN is to combine the concepts and practices of digital fabrication & prototyping electronices with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects. A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological \u2018black boxes\u2019 to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures. Structure and Phase \u00b6 Note The following timetable is provisional and may undergo modifications and adaptations during the course. 1 Block of Master classes \u00b6 01/02/23 - Basic electronics & Coding 02/02/23 - 2D Design tools (parametric design) 08/02/23 - 2D Fabrication (Laser, vinyl) 09/02/23 - Inputs / Outputs 14/02/23 - First Challenge (Intellectual property) 2 Block of Master classes \u00b6 08/03/23 - Networking 09/03/23 - 3D Scanning - 3D softwares 15/03/23 - Interfaces and machine interactions 16/03/23 - CNC 21/03/23 - Second Challenge (Intellectual property) 3 Block of Master classes \u00b6 26/04/23 - TBD - Advance Design 27/04/23 - Interfaces 03/05/23 - Wildcard week 04/05/23 - TBD - Coding 21/03/23 - Final Challenge (Intellectual property) Methodology \u00b6 The program apply Fab Academy mindset and set of skills, but applying new methodologies such as \"challenges\" , redistributing the impact of weekly hours and adding new assessment criteria. The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d . Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrating the competencies acquired. The challenges combine four weekly cycles into one intense project-based fabrication sprint. Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students. As mentioned before, the intention is to weave the two courses together in order to enhance both for the benefit of the students\u2019 projects. The design studio provides a critical context in relation to the technologies developed during Fab Academy, and in return the Fab Academy course yields the skills and knowledge to help physicalize these concepts. Materials Needs \u00b6 All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the classes. Bring in your laptop with the proper software installed prior to the class if required (emails will be sent prior to the classes regarding this aspect). Output \u00b6 Each student builds a portfolio on their respective websites that documents their mastery of different certificates taken individually along each week and their integration into a final, larger project, related to their masters thesis development. The DESIGN FOR PROTOTYPING COURSE is PASSED by growth progress rather than a global goal, for successful completion of each weekly assignment and challenge is a must.

The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d . Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrating the competencies acquired. The challenges combine four weekly cycles into one intense project-based fabrication sprint. Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve.

However, it also suggests that this ability is unique to Earth and its inhabitants, as it is the only known place in the galaxy where intelligence exists. As designers, we have the power to shape the world around us through the decisions we make and the actions we take. Whether it is the design of an object or the design of a system, our choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, choosing to take a private car instead of public transport not only affects the trip from A to B, but also contributes to pollution and climate change. Similarly, the design of our cities and suburbs can limit or expand our options for transportation. Design is not just about aesthetics or proportions, it is also about the attitude we have towards the world and the choices we make. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions. However, it is important to remember that these actions also have a collective impact and require a coordinated effort at multiple scales. The search for meaning and purpose is a lifelong journey that can be influenced by a variety of belief systems, such as philosophy, religion, and science. As designers, it is important to align our beliefs with our actions and build meaningful connections with our work. The MDEF (Masters in Designing Emergent Futures) seminar aims to align students' purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities in order to empower them to become agents of change. Through questioning and self-reflection, the seminar aims to rebuild the connection between students and their inner motivations and to provide opportunities for engaging with a diverse range of perspectives and ideas. The seminar is a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, where the aim is to incorporate a philosophical approach to designing for the future. When \u00b6 Tuesday, from 9 to 11 am.

Course objective \u00b6 One of the main goals of MDEF is to align students\u2019 purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities, in order to provide all the necessary means to become agents of change. In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students\u2019 decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters\u2019 projects. The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.

In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students\u2019 decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters\u2019 projects.

How does it affect operating from a transfeminist perspective in the field of design? Is it possible to design differently? What is Design Justice? What are the ethical issues raised by these approaches? Is it possible to relate differently to technologies and through technologies? What happens to presences? And who is accountable for absences? Who do we relegate to a condition of subalternity? How do we deal with epistemic violence? Learning Objectives \u00b6 \u2022 To understand the importance of the place of enunciation in Design. \u2022 To learn about different transfeminist proposals applied to design and experimental research. \u2022 Understanding the importance of accountability. \u2022 To know the basic principles of the so-called Design Justice.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the programme. Schedule \u00b6 11/04 Kick off - Framing your first Design Intervention for Term III \u00b6 Goals : Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a first design intervention for the term. Activity : Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 2 nd trimester. Present your personal alternative present. Deliverable : A proposal for the first intervention of the term based on the alternative present created (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after). Task : Start preparing and carrying out your first design intervention. 17/04 Design Studio Reviews \u00b6 24/4 Alternative presents to emergent futures- triggering tomorrow\u2019s tomorrow: MDEF Alumni Roundtable (TBC) Nicolas + Roberto + Magda + Mitalee \u00b6 Goals : Learn from different case studies how a 1PP alternative present design research investigation can become diverse professional roles, collaborations and hybrid ongoing practices. Activity : Roundtable contrasting different perspectives and life-stories. Deliverable : Update your alternative present including a description of the roles you would like to have in it. Task : Update your bio section in your website with an adaptation or your alternative present and your role. Continue developing your interventions. 02/05 Design Studio Reviews \u00b6 08/05 Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability - MDEF Alumni Guest Presentations (TBC) \u00b6 Goals : Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts Activity : To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions. Deliverable : Visualize the socio-technical system of your project (updated Design Space). Show possible paths of growth with new or existing actors. Task : Create a scalability roadmap for decentralization using the strategies presented in class. 15/05 Design Studio Reviews \u00b6 22/05 MDEFEST Introduction \u00b6 Goals : MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters\u2019 journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked on all year long. Activity : Students will design a session for the fest which its main goal will be to involve the community that they have worked with & that they will like to work with in the future. Deliverable : Planning of your session. Task : Pilot and run rehearsals of the sessions. Production, dissemination needs to be arranged at the same time 12/06 - 25/06 MDEFEST (DATES TBC) \u00b6 Goals : MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters\u2019 journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long. Activity : Sessions will last maximum half a day, can be digital or physical (with remote streaming), done individually or in groups (preferably) and can be in the format of a workshop, a debate, a visit, a meetup or any kind of format the students find suitable for this experience. Deliverable : Two-week time-frame to hold the sessions planned for the Fest. End of academic year deliverables - Due date: 16 th of June. \u00b6 10 High-resolution photos of the journey of your project and final interventions Master Thesis - Chapters 0-11, adding this Term the following chapters: Chapter 8 : Final Interventions: Descriptions and results Chapter 9 : Final Alternative Present Chapter 10 : Designing yourself out: Strategies for Continuity and Scalability Chapter 11 : Final Reflection Reference Sources / Bibliography (2-5) min Video Selected physical exhibition material for IAAC and Elisava - Poster + physical prototypes to be displayed for a few days (TBC with Chiara) Grading Method \u00b6 33% of the evaluation will be the Design Studio faculties\u2019 combined grade, 33% will be the average grade your peers give you, and 33% will be the completion of your first Thesis draft.

Aside from making, what do we aim to distribute? What are the values behind the design approach and how can they be used for designers and creatives to reflect on their design projects? How can we also use the values to measure impact in the creative and design industries? How can the Distributed Design Platform help advance the field of Distributed Design and provide support for emerging creative talents in the creative and design industries? These are the questions that we will address during the three-class seminar: Reflecting on Distributed Design. We will talk about the field of distributed design and how our vision of it has evolved to distribute not just making but to distribute knowledge, value and power. We will talk about Distributed Design and the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) as a space to unite approaches and methodologies including (but definitely not limited to) Doughnut Economics, Decolonizing Design, Ancestral Wisdom and Transfeminism. We\u2019ll do an initial exploration of the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) and the values and opportunities it presents. We\u2019ll also explore the importance of measuring impact in the design and creative fields and the tool we\u2019ve developed (the DDP Reflection Tree) as part of DDP to help assess the environmental and social impact. The seminar will also provide students with the opportunity to apply the DDP Reflection Tree to their final projects and foster moments for group reflections. Lastly, we\u2019ll explore the DDP values together and consider how they might be defined. Total Duration \u00b6 9 class hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 Class one: Theoretical (Wednesday, 12 th April 2023) \u00b6 In this first class, students will learn about the evolution of the DDP and essential topics related to the field of Distributed Design. We will also present the DDP values and talk about the importance of measuring impact. Lastly, we will cover useful information from the DDP, like members, resources and opportunity tracks that students might pursue. Class two: Practical (Thursday, 13 th April 2023) \u00b6 The DDP Reflection Tree will be introduced as a tool to help designers understand their project\u2019s relationship to the values of the DDP, while also providing invaluable insight for the DDP team into the impact of DD in the creative and design industries, as well as helping the DDP provide essential support to creative talents. Students will be split into groups of four to work on applying the DDP\u2019s Reflection Tree to their projects. Lastly, students will identify challenge areas they would like to further develop and receive feedback from their peers. Class three: Practical & Theoretical (Friday, 14 th April 2023) \u00b6 Following working with the DDP values in the Reflection Tree, students will work on contributing to the values. Step 1 (1 hour) : Students will break out into groups (4) around each of the DDP values and brainstorm what they envision the value looking like, based on the inputs from the seminar, the master\u2019s course and their own experience. They will have to create a presentation (using whatever format they see fit i.e powerpoint, theatrical piece, poster) to share with the rest of the class. Step 2 (40 minutes) : Students will present the work on their respective value (10 minute per presentation) Step 3 (1 hour 20 minutes) : The class and instructors will collectively provide feedback to each of the value presentations to help form what the values could look like. Materials Needs \u00b6 Class 1: 6 A0 prints of the mushroom model activity from WCCE (here is an adapted and printable version for the seminar) Sticky notes Class 2: 4 different colors of sticky notes 6 A0 prints of the DDP Reflection Tree Class 3: Big paper Sticky notes Markers Materials for collage (i.e. old magazines, brochures, etc.) Students should bring materials to collage with (if they feel they would want to present in that way) Deliverables / Outputs \u00b6 No special deliverables expected.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges. The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times. Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging. The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture. Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty. The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.","title":"Index"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/#academic-information-2018-19","text":"","title":"Academic Information 2018-19"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/#welcome-to-the-year-2018-19","text":"","title":"Welcome to the Year 2018-19"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/#the-design-for-emergent-futures-approach","text":"MDEF is both a theoretical and practical Master.

Articulate a narrative between these elements of your journey with a specific target audience in mind. Day 2: Practical Narratives Workshop with Kickstarter \u00b6 The construction of thoughtful, compelling narratives should extend beyond the creative aspects of your practice. \u201cPractical narratives\u201d \u2013 the kinds of stories you tell in grant writing, fundraising, business proposals, pitches and more \u2013 can be some of the most powerful communications in your career. In this session, we\u2019ll look at these kinds of narratives as an opportunity to invite your audience to get involved in your creative process, using the Kickstarter format as a new archetype to learn from. Workshop mini-structure: Context and analysis After an introductory lecture, we\u2019ll look at good examples of project proposals, drawn from Kickstarter and other sources \u2013 and analyse them together. Why are they compelling? What are they asking for? How are they inviting a crowd or community into their process? Exercise 1 (in-class) : Title, Subtitle & Lead Image Using a project idea of your own, sketch out a compelling title, subtitle, and lead image for your concept Exercise 2 (take home) : Outline or Storyboard Develop this first exercise into a proposal outline, or storyboard Day 3: Presentation and discussion \u00b6 Students present & discuss Exercise 2 One-on-one sessions Time for follow-up and individual feedback on students\u2019 own practical narratives Day 4: Tools for new engaging narratives \u00b6 Duckling argues that social media in its DNA is built to divide us because it\u2019s business model is based on micro-segmentation. So it\u2019s unlikely that social media will ever become beneficial for us. We have to build an entirely new media category instead. We call this next media category \u201cInsight media,\u201d and we built it on contextual and collective human thinking rather than personal promotion. We have made an app for Insight Media, which is called Duckling. Through Duckling, people create stories about their key insights, that are passed on, changed and expanded by the Duckling network. The result is ideas, insights, and inspiration that deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world. Mini-Workshop structure: General introduction to why documentary storytelling makes sense, why exactly now, and why in the Fablab context A bit of hands-on theory on how to construct a good documentary story Demo of Duckling and a small assignment Briefing on doing small stories the rest of the semester, and what it will generate for the students and for all of us. Day 5: Student Showcase \u00b6 Prepare a showcase of your narratives using computers and other types of screens in the classroom.

Laura Cl\u00e8ries From a PhD in Chemistry to future scouting and trend setting. Domestic Data Streamers With Pol Trias and Marta Handenawer. From product design to data enabled communication. Syllabus and Learning Objectives \u00b6 Research has shown that most of the jobs opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next years still don\u2019t exist. Instead of seeing it as a thread, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what it is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development specially in a master program full of activities. In this course, critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses. Group discussions will make you aware about how your thinking, interests and values differ from others. By means of a series of visits to key professionals, that have undergone a shift in their careers, we want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with. At the end of this course we expect you to understand who you are and what makes you unique (identity), have created a personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional, and a draft development plan on how to achieve it. Total Duration \u00b6 Classes: 3-5 p.m, Mon-Fri Student work hours: 20 per week Total hours per student: 35 Structure and Phases \u00b6 Homework (bootcamp): \u00b6 Finalize or improve your 1 st post on your personal web. \u00b7 Present yourself (your identity in relation to your strengths and weaknesses). \u00b7 Where would you be in 10 years (vision on design and your future role). \u00b7 What do you want to get out of the master program (personal development plan, what you want to accomplish during this year). Day 1 to 3 \u00b6 Visit and reflect on the hybrid profiles presented (points of convergence and divergence). Each visit will consist of the following: \u00b7 Introduction to their professional practice and where they work (university, study, company, \u2026) \u00b7 Background (how did they get where they are now) \u00b7 Practical exercise on a topic that is key for them \u00b7 Reflection with MDEF students about similarities and differences in their understanding of what design is, the role of technology and value for society. Day 4 \u00b6 Vision and Identity class, tools and techniques for self-reflection. Day 5 \u00b6 Personal development plan class, classes and FMP. Output \u00b6 In this course personal and group reflections are key, that is why we expect you to deliver a series of notes and conclusions from each activity. We want you to post them in your personal blog daily so other students can see them too.

Instead of seeing it as a thread, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what it is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development specially in a master program full of activities. In this course, critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses. Group discussions will make you aware about how your thinking, interests and values differ from others. By means of a series of visits to key professionals, that have undergone a shift in their careers, we want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with. At the end of this course we expect you to understand who you are and what makes you unique (identity), have created a personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional, and a draft development plan on how to achieve it.","title":"Syllabus and Learning Objectives"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/term_1_2018_19/exploring_hybrid_profiles_in_design_2018_19/#total-duration","text":"Classes: 3-5 p.m, Mon-Fri Student work hours: 20 per week Total hours per student: 35","title":"Total Duration"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/term_1_2018_19/exploring_hybrid_profiles_in_design_2018_19/#structure-and-phases","text":"","title":"Structure and Phases"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/term_1_2018_19/exploring_hybrid_profiles_in_design_2018_19/#homework-bootcamp","text":"Finalize or improve your 1 st post on your personal web. \u00b7 Present yourself (your identity in relation to your strengths and weaknesses). \u00b7 Where would you be in 10 years (vision on design and your future role). \u00b7 What do you want to get out of the master program (personal development plan, what you want to accomplish during this year).","title":"Homework (bootcamp):"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2018_19/term_1_2018_19/exploring_hybrid_profiles_in_design_2018_19/#day-1-to-3","text":"Visit and reflect on the hybrid profiles presented (points of convergence and divergence).

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown? Andersen was based at STEIM for 14 years, she was part of the Making Things Public art research program at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and lead the Instruments and Interfaces master\u2019s degree program at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague. She is a longstanding advisor of the Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie, and currently acts as expert reviewer for H2020, ICT and FET for both application and project reviews.

Nothing seems to change: fracking is a practice that is being increased, the poles are melting, and we are extinguishing animal species at a rate never seen before. This course is intended to help students framing research questions in an age of massive change and constant uncertainty.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least: An ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, and which determines the action pathways for global societies in a decisive way. A crisis that is not only environmental but also political and economic, being determined by the route of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented historical project spanning decades. And above all, because it is also a philosophical crisis, that of the project of recomposing our vision of the relationship between culture and nature, a relationship that has changed without the possibility of turning back. A crisis of the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years: neoliberalism, which today is unable to guarantee the welfare of contemporary societies, destabilized by precariousness and inequality. And the emerging stories about a next model, still discontinuous and tentative, that begin to articulate around the notion of postcapitalism. Multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, which have opened a gap between institutional politics and citizenship, creating a space of opportunity for which new political movements with multiple origins struggle: from activism and grassroots social movements, to media populisms or the xenophobic reactionary movements. Together with these, a crisis of the global geopolitical order, which is once again dominated by the tension between poles. And of course, a crisis of the nation-state of the twentieth century, which is fragmented in search of other possible configurations for the 21 st century. A crisis of the discourses of the most recent utopia, the digital utopia, and of the visions that found in technological innovation the answer and the cure to all the other crises. The technological regime of the last 15 years has ceased to be perceived as an unequivocal force of progress, and citizens begin to distrust some actors, the giants of Silicon Valley, who have perfected new and disturbing mechanisms of exploitation, eroding the fabric of our societies. A crisis of the productive model and the nature of work in the face of the growing development of automation and robotization and Artificial Intelligence. A crisis that places nation-states in direct conflict with new agents, whose impact and ability to influence rivals that of governments. And in which new imaginaries emerge about what a world would look like after work, and horizons like the myth of the Universal Basic Income A crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business. The thrust of alternative stories and the active mobilization of a multiplicity of collectives \u2014from women and migrants to the LGTBQI collective\u2014 calls for a more diverse society, with a more equitable distribution of power. A migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply, and in which protectionist speeches return and barriers are raised again. These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development. What does it mean to live and coexist in these conditions of departure? How do we design for these times that are necessarily cyborg and for the anthropocene? What narratives, images, symbols and aesthetics help us find and recognize ourselves in this space? From these 9 vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures. Total Duration \u00b6 Classes: 15 hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 Every class is made up of an initial long lecture by the Faculty, followed by discussion among the students to pick a topic to develop further into a proposal for a possible assignement. At the end of the class all groups will settle on the topic of their presentations the following day. Output \u00b6 Presentations, one per group in the last 4 classes.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least: An ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, and which determines the action pathways for global societies in a decisive way. A crisis that is not only environmental but also political and economic, being determined by the route of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented historical project spanning decades. And above all, because it is also a philosophical crisis, that of the project of recomposing our vision of the relationship between culture and nature, a relationship that has changed without the possibility of turning back.

It has been a trajectory that has taken us from traditional crafts where the designer and the maker were the same person, to a predominantly digital design process that is almost entirely based on concepts, form and theory and where the product development and fabrication are left in the hands of others. But, making is back. Digital fabrication tools are engaging people in the process of designing and making physical objects in all parts of the world. Still, in the historical journey of design changing from analogue to digital and from the hands to the head, the in-depth knowledge of materials and how work with them, have been pushed out. This knowledge gap represents a major issue when designing sustainable physical objects (and in many other aspects). The main reason being that up to 80%of sustainability impacts are decided at the product design stage (Kulatunga et al., 2015; Lewis, Gertsakis, Grant, Morelli, & Sweatman, 2017). This effectively means that the designer is the creator of a recipe and will unavoidably make decisions that follow the product through its lifecycle. Therefore, the aim of this course is to bring the material dialogue which distinguished traditional craftsmanship back in to the contemporary design process. Materials and fabrication have radically changed in complexity and numbers since the industrial revolution and the environment are on several parameters at a state of collapse, so the situation calls for a new approach to raw materials and manufacturing. This brings us in to a field defined by art, natural science and technology where designers manipulate, grow or develop the material for a product in the same process as designing form and function. This is also called Material Driven Design Total Duration \u00b6 Classes: 60 hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 Thursday 24 th January \u00b6 Theory - Introductions to: Definition of sustainability and circular economy, alternative material ressources, the material dialogue from craft, embodied cognition.

These projects constitute socio-technical interventions on reality which take as reference the coordinates offered in the contents of the master: urban environment, digital manufacturing, technology, new design postures \u2026 These interventions are beginning to outline possible, critical and/or desirable futures that are to be constituted as alternative normalities. One of the pillars of the evolving body of knowledge that constitutes Transition Design is that of the theories of change, that is, the mental, theoretical and practical frameworks under which change happens and is meant. In this context, Transition Design bets on a reconquest of everydayness as a political positioning and an engine of change that builds bridges between the hitherto opposed theories that explain change from normative structures and the individual agency. One of the most promising cultural theories for explaining social phenomena and analysing everyday life is that of Social Practices. The analysis of present practices as well as their historical evolution and future potentialities creates fertile ground for an aesthetic policy that questions the status-quo and overcomes the crisis of imagination in which we live submerged as a civilization. We believe the adoption of this tools, mindsets and theoretical scaffolds might expand design\u2019s ability to construct preferred futures from a systems perspective. Throughout the course the design interventions proposed by the students will be framed under the theory of social practices as a means for: Understanding and reflecting on the implications of the performativity of everyday life in the creation of new normalities from a mind-body perspective and the role that design plays in that context.

In this course, participants will work in collaborative ways to design fictional narratives around the concept of internet citizenships and post-technological futures, integrating their final projects and research insights, using as a 1 billion second time horizon together with key insights from the research themes that IAM has been exploring in the last years, in particular from 2019\u2019s theme: The Quantumness of Archipelagos, a \u2018what if?\u2019 remix of ideas coming from philosophy, geography, queer theory and quantum physics, shaped as an experimental thinking tool to deal with the complexity of our realities and a lens through which we can imagine alternatives, collectively. The course will run as an experimental studio during 12 hours (split into 4 sessions), where participants will need self-organise to achieve a collective goal, refine the key questions shaping their projects, practice consensus, reflection, self-grading and shared learnings that will inform the individual projects and also the group performance. The main goal of this format is not only the quality of the final output but most importantly the collective learnings from running a studio, working in collaborative ways and developing interconnected mindsets around three main ideas: critical optimism, long-term strategies and planetary narratives.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Thus, any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least an ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, a crisis of neoliberalism as the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years, multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, a crisis of the discourses that grew with the digital utopias, a crisis of the productive model and the nature of work, a crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business, and last but not least, a migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply. These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development. As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of the Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities. From these vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures. Atlas of the Weak Signals: Intro \u00b6 The seminar itself will be structured in stages, being the goal of this first one to give the students a general overview of the 25 current Signals that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hiper-local view of some of the vectors of the Atlas. Total Duration \u00b6 Classes: 15 hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 Session 1 will be dedicated to present a general introduction to the topics of the Atlas of the Weak Signals. The introduction will be given as a seminar by Jose Luis de Vicente, Senior Faculty of the course. Session 2 will be dedicated to present the state of the work developed by former students and faculty, with a showcase of some of the best projects developed in the past year, as well as a selection of relevant research projects developed by IAAC and ELISAVA\u2019s research groups within the topics of the Atlas. Session 3 will be dedicated to a practical methodology in which the students will be encouraged to start positioning themselves and their research interests within the intersections of the Atlas, investigating how and in which intersection their areas of interests and projects stand. Session 4 will present a special guest to help us transition down from a global view of the Atlas to the case study of a specific context: Cuba. Ernesto Oroza, cuban artist and designer, will approach some of the weak signals contemplated in the Atlas from the perspective of his expertise and work within the cuban context. Ernesto Oroza And finally Session 5, as a closure to this first introductory week, will be closed by a methodology lead also by Oroza in which students will explore the topics presented throughout the week, being challenged to speculate and project possible future scenarios and interventions that take into consideration global vectors as well as hiper-local challenges and realities. Later in the academic year during Term II, the course will have the follow-up of this introductory course with the in-depth seminar that will investigate each one of the signals, guiding the students deeper into their selected intersections and areas of interests. Output \u00b6 Once the course ends, each one of the students is expected to write an individual post reflecting on the journey we took during the week. You will elaborate on what you take from this course trying to answer the main question on where your research interests and possible intervention stand: Which of the weak signals that we identified and discussed during the week are personally more interesting to you and your project as areas of research? Which do you feel that particularly have an impact on you and your future? Why? Due date for this final deliverable will be 1 week after the course finishes. Grading Method \u00b6 Participation and attendance during the week: 30%. Final submission: 70%.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Thus, any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least an ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, a crisis of neoliberalism as the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years, multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, a crisis of the discourses that grew with the digital utopias, a crisis of the productive model and the nature of work, a crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business, and last but not least, a migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply. These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development. As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of the Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities. From these vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures.","title":"Syllabus and Learning Objectives"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term1_2019_20/#atlas-of-the-weak-signals-intro","text":"The seminar itself will be structured in stages, being the goal of this first one to give the students a general overview of the 25 current Signals that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hiper-local view of some of the vectors of the Atlas.","title":"Atlas of the Weak Signals: Intro"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term1_2019_20/#total-duration","text":"Classes: 15 hours","title":"Total Duration"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term1_2019_20/#structure-and-phases","text":"Session 1 will be dedicated to present a general introduction to the topics of the Atlas of the Weak Signals.

The project is thought to be ephemeral and the life cycle has to well thought through. What happens to the studio after the course finishes? What is the afterlife of the elements they will create? The first phase of the seminar is to conduct a participatory design proposal to be presented and discussed with the groups. Students will design from the raw studio space, taking into account Fab Lab Barcelona as main work space as well as using any available resources within the neighbourhood in terms of production, materials and inspiration. In the second phase the best elements of the proposals will be produced with the help of Francesco Zonca a digital fabrication specialist. Students will learn how to use laser, CNC, 3D printing and scanning machines in an intensive course to understand workflows using their creations as the subject.

Steinblock Syllabus and Learning Objectives \u00b6 Capitalism has been or is the leading economic system and the way of understanding business and how the three sectors (Public, Private and Civil) interact. Money makes the world go round. If we want to Design the Emergent Future, we need to understand how entities (humans and businesses) interact, record transactions and how the economy is influenced by private ownership, behaviour, expectations, markets and rules. Students will briefly go thru the recent history of Macro Economics and discuss Classical Economy, Keynesian Economics to understand how we ended with overwhelmed governments and international institutions discussing, QE, tariffs, migration policies and SDG\u2019s. The first unit will finish with a brief introduction to Micro Economics where students will discuss opportunity costs, elasticity, markets, pricing & competition. The second part will be explaining the basic accounting equation and the dual entry principle. What do Financial Statements tell us and what are their shortcomings? In this unit the course provides a deep enough understanding of assets, liabilities & equity. What are the basic rules behind the so called \u2018business language\u2019? The fundamentals of the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement will be explained and discussed. The last unit of the course will be around Time in the broader sense: Where are we as human kind at the beginning of the XXI Century? \u2022 Debt: Public & Private \u2022 Time Preference \u2022 Accelerating Business Growth \u2022 Derivatives All together the Learning Objectives are to arm the students with basic understanding and tools on where we are, how we got here and what can be done to design the imminent future in a more sustainable environment conducting business and transacting goods or services for equivalent resources or money. Among these objectives students will find: \u2022 Understand and criticize the most important economic theories \u2022 Appreciate the importance of the Supply and Demand model \u2022 Identify the economic issues and point out possible solutions \u2022 Generate awareness how business transactions affect the element of the accounting equation \u2022 Explain how economies of scale can reduce unit costs \u2022 Identify strategies that companies use to lower their break-even point \u2022 Examine the theory and practice of financing an entity using debt & equity \u2022 Enable to assess the benefit of \u2018access over ownership\u2019 Total Duration \u00b6 Classes : Monday - Friday 3:00 - 6:00 pm Student Working Hours : 12 Total Hours : 27 hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 D1 \u00b7 Intro \u00b7 From barter to e-money \u00b7 Brief intro to Macro Economics D2 \u00b7 Micro Economics \u00b7 Costs Calculations D3 \u00b7 The accounting equation \u00b7 Fundamentals of the Balance Sheet D4 \u00b7 Income Statement \u00b7 Cash Budget D5 \u00b7 Funding \u00b7 Time Preference \u00b7 Derivatives Output \u00b6 TBD Bibliography \u00b6 Accounting and Financial Fundamentals for non Financial Executives R.

Steinblock Linkedin BLOCKCHAIN, The Value Transmission \u00b6 Syllabus and Learning Objectives \u00b6 The world of cryptocurrencies and their initial sales events or ICO (Initial Coin Offer) are part of our economic and social reality. Knowing the fundamental technical and philosophical concepts of blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrencies are based, is essential to understand new business models and new distributed services. It is essential to know the main existing blockchain networks and their associated cryptocurrencies or tokens.

Money makes the world go round. If we want to Design the Emergent Future, we need to understand how entities (humans and businesses) interact, record transactions and how the economy is influenced by private ownership, behaviour, expectations, markets and rules. Students will briefly go thru the recent history of Macro Economics and discuss Classical Economy, Keynesian Economics to understand how we ended with overwhelmed governments and international institutions discussing, QE, tariffs, migration policies and SDG\u2019s. The first unit will finish with a brief introduction to Micro Economics where students will discuss opportunity costs, elasticity, markets, pricing & competition. The second part will be explaining the basic accounting equation and the dual entry principle. What do Financial Statements tell us and what are their shortcomings? In this unit the course provides a deep enough understanding of assets, liabilities & equity. What are the basic rules behind the so called \u2018business language\u2019? The fundamentals of the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement will be explained and discussed. The last unit of the course will be around Time in the broader sense: Where are we as human kind at the beginning of the XXI Century? \u2022 Debt: Public & Private \u2022 Time Preference \u2022 Accelerating Business Growth \u2022 Derivatives All together the Learning Objectives are to arm the students with basic understanding and tools on where we are, how we got here and what can be done to design the imminent future in a more sustainable environment conducting business and transacting goods or services for equivalent resources or money. Among these objectives students will find: \u2022 Understand and criticize the most important economic theories \u2022 Appreciate the importance of the Supply and Demand model \u2022 Identify the economic issues and point out possible solutions \u2022 Generate awareness how business transactions affect the element of the accounting equation \u2022 Explain how economies of scale can reduce unit costs \u2022 Identify strategies that companies use to lower their break-even point \u2022 Examine the theory and practice of financing an entity using debt & equity \u2022 Enable to assess the benefit of \u2018access over ownership\u2019","title":"Syllabus and Learning Objectives"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/emergent_economies_2019_20/#total-duration","text":"Classes : Monday - Friday 3:00 - 6:00 pm Student Working Hours : 12 Total Hours : 27 hours","title":"Total Duration"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/emergent_economies_2019_20/#structure-and-phases","text":"D1 \u00b7 Intro \u00b7 From barter to e-money \u00b7 Brief intro to Macro Economics D2 \u00b7 Micro Economics \u00b7 Costs Calculations D3 \u00b7 The accounting equation \u00b7 Fundamentals of the Balance Sheet D4 \u00b7 Income Statement \u00b7 Cash Budget D5 \u00b7 Funding \u00b7 Time Preference \u00b7 Derivatives","title":"Structure and Phases"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/emergent_economies_2019_20/#output","text":"TBD","title":"Output"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/emergent_economies_2019_20/#bibliography","text":"Accounting and Financial Fundamentals for non Financial Executives R.

Instead of seeing it as a thread, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what it is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development specially in a master program full of activities. In this course, critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses. Group discussions will make you aware about how your thinking, interests and values differ from others. By means of a series of visits to key professionals, that have undergone a shift in their careers, we want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with. At the end of this course we expect you to understand who you are and what makes you unique (identity), have created a personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional, and a draft development plan on how to achieve it.

Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half-century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself. TAUMs is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during Fab Academy. We will be going over the basic skills needed to design, develop, and fabricate almost anything in a Fab Lab, as well as how to manage time and resources necessary for its proper operation. Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development , designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition. We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an \u201chonest\u201d mechanical artifact that \u201cmakes\u201d something. USELESS MACHINES \u00b6 As existential purity, building a machine that doesn\u00b4t have a clear purpose as fabricating something or solve world problems allows the designer to focus on mechanics and movements allowing more freedom to really simplify actuation forgetting about constraints. The metaphor of machines and artefacts doing endless predefined or random movements is what we call Useless Machines. Students will develop and fabricate something that is a mess of contradictions and wonderfulness. Context \u00b6 It has been a long tradition among philosophers and writers to praise uselessness as a means to stress the importance of spiritual activities and creations without clear functional aims. Aristotle, for one, established early on that knowledge was valuable in itself, not for providing practical utility\u2014a notion frequently forgotten today. To praise in utility, thus, has been a reaction to the materialistic values promoted by capitalist society, which has been criticized for its lack of moral and spiritual values. Because machines are generally associated with the fulfilment of a practical duty, the functional independence of art is particularly highlighted when artists create or represent machines. We find ultimate examples of useless art machines in Wim Delvoye\u2019s pursuit of technologically sophisticated devices for the production of excrement, or in Roxy Paine\u2019s machines to fabricate art, which we can consider two times \u201cuseless\u201d: for being artworks and for producing more art.

Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half-century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself. TAUMs is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during Fab Academy. We will be going over the basic skills needed to design, develop, and fabricate almost anything in a Fab Lab, as well as how to manage time and resources necessary for its proper operation. Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development , designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition. We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an \u201chonest\u201d mechanical artifact that \u201cmakes\u201d something.","title":"Syllabus and Learning Objectives"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#useless-machines","text":"As existential purity, building a machine that doesn\u00b4t have a clear purpose as fabricating something or solve world problems allows the designer to focus on mechanics and movements allowing more freedom to really simplify actuation forgetting about constraints.

Aristotle, for one, established early on that knowledge was valuable in itself, not for providing practical utility\u2014a notion frequently forgotten today. To praise in utility, thus, has been a reaction to the materialistic values promoted by capitalist society, which has been criticized for its lack of moral and spiritual values. Because machines are generally associated with the fulfilment of a practical duty, the functional independence of art is particularly highlighted when artists create or represent machines. We find ultimate examples of useless art machines in Wim Delvoye\u2019s pursuit of technologically sophisticated devices for the production of excrement, or in Roxy Paine\u2019s machines to fabricate art, which we can consider two times \u201cuseless\u201d: for being artworks and for producing more art.","title":"Context"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#schedule","text":"","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#total-duration","text":"Classes: Mon-Thu (15 per week) Student work hours: Mon-Thursday (13 per week) Total hours per student: 28 hours Presentation: Thursday From 13 to 14h.","title":"Total Duration"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#calendar","text":"","title":"Calendar"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#monday","text":"Morning session 10h(sharp)to 14h 10:00 - 11:00 -> Introduction + Artifacts prototype DEMO + Q&A 11:00 - 11:30 -> Group formation Skills start 11:30 - 12:30 -> GROUP WORKING Design brainstorming Output: 2 ideas + references 12:30 - 13:30 -> CONTINUOUS REVIEWs Design brainstorming (Tutors goinng group by group) 13:30 - 14:00 -> Conclusions and group ideas presentation(sharing concepts) Afternoon session 15-19h 15:00 - 17:00 -> GROUP WORKING First prototypes 17:00 - 19:00 -> CONTINUOUS REVIEWs Fabrication an materializing methodology (by tutors)","title":"Monday"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#tuesday","text":"Morning session 10h(sharp)to 14h 10:00 - 10:30 -> From Design to Replicability 10:30 - 14:00 -> GROUP WORKING v0.0 Artifacts fabrication Afternoon session 15-19h 15:00 - 16:00 -> CONTINUOUS REVIEWs Fabrication/mechatronics/electronics (by tutors) 16:00 - 19:00 -> GROUP WORKING v1.0 Artifacts fabrication","title":"Tuesday"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#wednesday","text":"Morning session 10h(sharp)to 14h 10:00 - 11:30 -> Troubleshooting (by tutors) 11:30 - 14:00 -> GROUP WORKING Final production of artifacts V2.0 Afternoon session 15-19h 15:00 - 19:00 -> Final artifacts V2.0 and videoshoot of working prototypes,pictures,final presentation start","title":"Wednesday"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#thursday-final-day","text":"Morning session 10h(sharp)to 14h 10:00 - 12:00 -> Videoshoot of working prototypes,pictures,final presentation and video/media editing. 12:00 - 14:00 -> Artifacts presentation 14:00 - 15:00 -> Learning Dimensions Design principles \u201cHonest\u201d mechanical artifact, All the element must be seen accounted for \u201cINTEGRATIVE\" Build on top of hacked parts Maximize useless with the minimum amount of elements, minimalism","title":"Thursday - Final day"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#output","text":"\u201cHonest\u201d mechanical artifact (1 input and/or 1 outputs + 2 differents fabrication process)","title":"Output"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#evaluation","text":"Reflection (post): 5% Conceptualitzation (From ideas to artifacts): 30% Assistance: 10% Involvement (individual): 10% Presentation (slides and videos): 40% If it does not explode: 5%","title":"Evaluation"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#materials-and-resources","text":"Techniques - Laser Cutter - 3d Printing - CNC machining - Recycling - Hand tools - Welding - Soldering","title":"Materials and resources"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#materials","text":"Arduinos unos (max 2 per group) Basic set of sensors Distance Light Sound Touch Magnetic Button Temp/humidity Basic set of actuators Steppers(max 1 per group) Servos DC motors Water/air pumps Electromagnet Relay LED Each team will have a power supply 12v 10amp 1x Wood 12-15(based on availability)1200x1200mm max 1x Wood or acrylic 3-5mmm 800x600mm max Cables Background Research Material","title":"Materials"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_1_2019_20/the_almost_useful_machines_2019_20/#working-methodology","text":"The whole class will be divided in groups of 4 people.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least: An ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, and which determines the action pathways for global societies in a decisive way. A crisis that is not only environmental but also political and economic, being determined by the route of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented historical project spanning decades. And above all, because it is also a philosophical crisis, that of the project of recomposing our vision of the relationship between culture and nature, a relationship that has changed without the possibility of turning back. A crisis of the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years: neoliberalism, which today is unable to guarantee the welfare of contemporary societies, destabilized by precariousness and inequality. And the emerging stories about a next model, still discontinuous and tentative, that begin to articulate around the notion of postcapitalism. Multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, which have opened a gap between institutional politics and citizenship, creating a space of opportunity for which new political movements with multiple origins struggle: from activism and grassroots social movements, to media populisms or the xenophobic reactionary movements. Together with these, a crisis of the global geopolitical order, which is once again dominated by the tension between poles. And of course, a crisis of the nation-state of the twentieth century, which is fragmented in search of other possible configurations for the 21 st century. A crisis of the discourses of the most recent utopia, the digital utopia, and of the visions that found in technological innovation the answer and the cure to all the other crises. The technological regime of the last 15 years has ceased to be perceived as an unequivocal force of progress, and citizens begin to distrust some actors, the giants of Silicon Valley, who have perfected new and disturbing mechanisms of exploitation, eroding the fabric of our societies. A crisis of the productive model and the nature of work in the face of the growing development of automation and robotization and Artificial Intelligence. A crisis that places nation-states in direct conflict with new agents, whose impact and ability to influence rivals that of governments. And in which new imaginaries emerge about what a world would look like after work, and horizons like the myth of the Universal Basic Income A crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business. The thrust of alternative stories and the active mobilization of a multiplicity of collectives \u2014from women and migrants to the LGTBQI collective\u2014 calls for a more diverse society, with a more equitable distribution of power. A migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply, and in which protectionist speeches return and barriers are raised again. These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development. What does it mean to live and coexist in these conditions of departure? How do we design for these times that are necessarily cyborg and for the anthropocene? What narratives, images, symbols and aesthetics help us find and recognize ourselves in this space? From these 9 vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures. Total Duration \u00b6 Classes: 15 hours Structure and Phases \u00b6 Every class is made up of an initial long lecture by the Faculty, followed by discussion among the students to pick a topic to develop further into a proposal for a possible assignement. At the end of the class all groups will settle on the topic of their presentations the following day. Output \u00b6 Presentations, one per group in the last 4 classes. Grading Method \u00b6 Presentation 50%, participation in discussions in class 50%. Mariana Quintero \u00b6 Multimedia developer, interaction designer & researcher, Mariana Quintero works and develops her practice at the intersection where digital fabrication technologies, digital literacy, and information and computation ethics & aesthetics meet, contributing to projects that investigate how digital information and technologies translate, represent, and mediate knowledge about the world. She is currently a faculty member and part of the strategic team at the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures at IAAC | Fab Lab Barcelona Email Address mariana.quintero@iaac.net Personal Website ( https://mqvlm.github.io/ ) Jose Luis de Vicente \u00b6 Jose Luis de Vicente is a cultural researcher and curator working in the space between the arts, technology, and innovation. Since 2012 he has been an associated curator for FutureEverything. He is the curator of S\u00f3nar +D, the digital culture and creative technologies conference and exhibition part of Barcelona\u2019s acclaimed S\u00f3nar Festival. In the last 15 years, he has developed multiple exhibition projects, including the internationally touring show \u201cBig Bang Data\u201d (CCCB Barcelona, Somerset House London, Art Science Museum Singapore, MIT Museum, Cambridge) and more recently, \u201cAfter the End of the World\u201d (CCCB Barcelona, FACT-Bluecoat-Riba Liverpool). Recent projects include Tentacular, a brand new festival of Critical Tech and Digital Adventures for Matadero (Madrid), and the curation of the 2019 edition of Llum BCN, Barcelona\u2019s light festival. He was a founder of the Visualizar Program for Data Culture (Medialab Prado, Madrid) and is a faculty member at IaaC (Catalonia\u2019s Institute for Advanced Architecture).","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_2_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term_2_2019_20/#structure-of-2019-20","text":"","title":"Structure of 2019-20"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_2_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term_2_2019_20/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_2_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term_2_2019_20/#faculty","text":"Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds de Vicente and Mariana Quintero","title":"Faculty"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2019_20/term_2_2019_20/atlas_of_weak_signals_term_2_2019_20/#syllabus-and-learning-objectives","text":"Every future scenario is built by detecting \u201cweak signals\u201d that set trends and point to certain directions, based on the analysis of the main change factors we can detect in the present.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analysing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time, it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the program.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges. The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times. Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging. The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture. Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty. The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015.

The agenda of democratizing access to the sciences is shared with that of libre software and open-source electronics and maker movements. Access to the means experimentation for the investigative and applied sciences will not only change the way we understand and describe the world but also bring forth new knowledge, designs, and engineering practices previously constrained to larger-scale operations. Through the course, researchers will learn how to identify microorganisms, how to take samples and prepare cultivation media, how to observe microscopic organisms and to obtain amplify DNA and analyze it. Researchers will be introduced t scientific concepts such as sterility, metabolism, genome, synthetic biology, biochemistry, and microbiology. Gaining the ability to make creative decisions and construct logical frameworks for study and production in the field of biology. Syllabus Material Craftivism \u00b6 'Consumer culture' portrays itself as the provider of instant access to any commodities we could want, from anywhere in the world, at an affordable price. This discourse, detached from the material process of production of these commodities (e.g. textiles/minerals/meat/pornography/plastics) invisibilizes the difficult truths intrinsic to their production. The sites of production are conveniently 'elsewhere' than the global north which reaps the rewards of this eco-social devastation. While a superficial 'awareness' of the social and ecological impact is readily provided by this same culture there is an absence of concrete and viable actions informed by material reality that do not lend themselves to become similarly commodified themselves. Through practice comes knowledge, by working directly with materials to understand the skills, energy, resources, chemistry, economics and human labor underpinning their production we can begin to envision alternative approaches to organizing production. 'Material Craftivism' is a practice-based approach to material research and knowledge exchange with the aim of developing and supporting alternative frameworks of production and consumption. We want to create a society of material makers, where open recipes are shared and democratised, enabling practitioners to design the performance, the aesthetical qualities, the properties and the life cycle of products, services and platforms.

This discourse, detached from the material process of production of these commodities (e.g. textiles/minerals/meat/pornography/plastics) invisibilizes the difficult truths intrinsic to their production. The sites of production are conveniently 'elsewhere' than the global north which reaps the rewards of this eco-social devastation. While a superficial 'awareness' of the social and ecological impact is readily provided by this same culture there is an absence of concrete and viable actions informed by material reality that do not lend themselves to become similarly commodified themselves. Through practice comes knowledge, by working directly with materials to understand the skills, energy, resources, chemistry, economics and human labor underpinning their production we can begin to envision alternative approaches to organizing production. 'Material Craftivism' is a practice-based approach to material research and knowledge exchange with the aim of developing and supporting alternative frameworks of production and consumption. We want to create a society of material makers, where open recipes are shared and democratised, enabling practitioners to design the performance, the aesthetical qualities, the properties and the life cycle of products, services and platforms.","title":"Syllabus Material Craftivism"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2020_21/term_1_2020_21/bio_%26_agri_0_2020_21/#when","text":"From 20 th to 30 th of October","title":"When"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2020_21/term_1_2020_21/bio_%26_agri_0_2020_21/#schedule","text":"Note: The materials toolkit only provides the Ingredients, but not the Tools and Miscellaneous!","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2020_21/term_1_2020_21/bio_%26_agri_0_2020_21/#modality-in-person-online","text":"","title":"Modality: In-person/ Online"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2020_21/term_1_2020_21/bio_%26_agri_0_2020_21/#output-bio-agri-0","text":"Students will design and hand-in their own notebooks in an innovative research fashion.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises, and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources. When \u00b6 Every Monday Schedule \u00b6 Monday 05/10 - 3 to 6 pm CET - 1 st Person Perspective Design Interventions \u00b6 Goals : Being resilient and resourceful as a professional. Learn about 1PP iterative design interventions methodology. Activity 1 : Reflect on how the new normal is shaping you personally. Explore and document a day in your life with notes, photos, videos, self-interviews\u2026 Deliverable 1 : One post with some visuals about my new me (photo, video, graphics, mood board,...). Activity 2 : Accept and reflect on how the new normal is shaping you as a professional. Rethinking your new hyper-local and hyper-connected workspace. Deliverable 2 : Two posts with a new workspace including what infrastructure, people, things, and materials became available either physical or virtual in this new normal Monday 19/10 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Roles of Prototyping in Research through Design \u00b6 Objectives : To learn about the different roles of prototyping in design research. Assignment : From the different roles that prototypes play in design research, reflect which ones you have used in the past and which ones you could include in your practice. Deliverable : Create your own RtD toolbox. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use. Monday 02/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Areas of intervention in a Multiscalar Design Space \u00b6 Goals : To learn what is a design space where you want to take your areas of interest identified in the Atlas of the Week Signals. A design space is a physical collection of experiments, reference objects, products or materials that support the development of your intervention as an action research exercise. Activity : Bring your \u201cResource cartography in the wild\u201d. Develop a design space integrating prototypes and projects you developed previously, your new me and workspace, the atlas of weak signals and the \u201cresource cartography in the wild\u201d. Deliverable : A design space that is adaptable and can grow over time including the state of the art, your weak signals, resources, and personal projects. Frame your ideas in relation to your area of interest provided in the AWS. Create a design space where these relationships are visible. Your design space should contain at least: \u20223 objects/products that represent the issues you are enquiring in a tangible way. \u20223 kinds of materials that express some of the qualities of these issues. (If you had to represent your issue through materials, which would they be?). \u20223 reference projects or initiatives that are working around those issues (pictures, blueprints, etc) \u20222 reference technologies / methodologies that are being used to investigate/attend those situations \u20222 possible contexts in Barcelona (or not) in which you would be interested to place an intervention \u20222 experiments that allow you to prototype your intervention. The format of this deliverable can be physical or digital, but document it with pictures or screenshots to submit to your drive folder and share with the class. Monday 16/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Collaborative Documentation & Swarm Intelligence \u00b6 Goals : To explore and develop forms of aggregative documentation, building collective intelligence resources Activity : Develop a collective framework to document explorations using the existing digital platforms, build a physical map of resources in the design studio. Deliverable : Your first collaborative design intervention with the groups or communities of practice you established at the end of the Collective Wall exercise. Monday 30/11 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Framing and Making Sense of Complexity through Reflective Practices \u00b6 Objectives : To incorporate a series of tools and methodologies to navigate through complexity in a current continuously changing reality. Assignment : Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development and by means of comparing yourself and your current project to previous projects, situations you have been, and other projective techniques that will be explained in class. Deliverable : Second intervention. Individually or collaboratively, building on the learnings from the first one. Monday 14/12 - 3 to 6 pm CET - Design Dialogues preparation \u00b6 Design Dialogues \u00b6 Objectives : to define an area of intervention and to present the first experiments at a personal level, and in an immediate context. To produce the first group exhibition of the master\u2019s projects. Deliverables : A series of prototypes presented in a design space, a video of no more than 3 minutes (answering the question what is your fight), and a written text of 1500 words (context/area of interest, opportunities of intervention, and state of the art).

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown?

Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half-century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself. TAUMs is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during Fab Academy. We will be going over the basic skills needed to design, develop, and fabricate almost anything in a Fab Lab, as well as how to manage time and resources necessary for its proper operation. Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development , designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition. We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an \u201chonest\u201d mechanical artifact that \u201cmakes\u201d something. USELESS MACHINES \u00b6 As existential purity, building a machine that doesn\u00b4t have a clear purpose as fabricating something or solve world problems allows the designer to focus on mechanics and movements allowing more freedom to really simplify actuation forgetting about constraints. The metaphor of machines and artifacts doing endless predefined or random movements is what we call Useless Machines. Students will develop and fabricate something that is a mess of contradictions and wonderfulness. UNPACKING INTELLIGENT MACHINES \u00b6 An introduction to physical computing by hacking everyday objects We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces whose underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design. Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

Starting from a personal position and progressing into a collective vision they will build an engaging narrative around change using a curatorial process. The course will ask designers to explore a broad scope of connections, associations and references to contextualize their own work in order to communicate their area of interest, issues, type of change and overarching message. Through a co-creative process, they will then explore synergies with others in order to merge and evolve a joint proposal. During this process, they will identify themes and reframe their work into a collective narrative, understand audiences and interrogate appropriate formats. The course is modelled on a design process that draws on curatorial practice. Learning through productive processes and using them to generate knowledge. Discussion of curatorial approaches will include exploring subjects through scripting, visualization, and materialization. It will touch on: curatorial concepts, thematic and narrative structures, engagement, Interpretation, gateway exhibits, key messages, stakeholder and audience development, issues of environment and media, and particular rethinking programs and formats.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analysing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time, it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the program. When \u00b6 Tuesdays from 3 to 6 pm, every two weeks Schedule \u00b6 06/04 Kick off - Framing your Final Design Intervention (Alternative presents -triggering tomorrow\u2019s tomorrow) \u00b6 a. Goals : Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a final design intervention. b. Activity : Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 2 nd trimester. c. Deliverable : A proposal for the final intervention (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after) d. Task : Start preparing and carrying out your final design intervention. 23/04 Measuring Impact - Strategies for Analysing your Final Design Intervention - Giovanni Macanni - Ideas For Change \u00b6 a. Goals : Learn different strategies and methodologies of measuring impact in innovation projects, applying this knowledge to design and implement a system for your own interventions. b. Activity : Understand the dimensions of your intervention that can be measured and which elements would constitute the system that would be able to give you feedback. In order to reflect on possible future iterations and to share the impact your activities have with others as part of your narrative. c. Deliverable : Design a strategy to measure impact during and after your interventions. d. Task : Pilot and iterate this strategy with your community, reflect on the results and the experience with its implementation. 04/05 Response-ability into the future - Sergio Urue\u00f1a \u00b6 a. Goals : Understand the philosophical and political foundations of care, b. Activity : Analyse and map the reach of what you are able to respond to using the guidelines presented by the guest lecturer. c. Deliverable : Reflect on what responsible innovation and anticipation means for your project based on what you learned in this session with Sergio. You can support this reflection with the survey he asked you to do before class and the Vision Assessment Exercise he proposed at the end of the session (Causal Layered Analysis). d. Task : Activity proposed by Guest Lecturer on his suggested material. 18/05 Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability - Marcel van Heist \u00b6 a. Goals : Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts. b. Activity : To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions. c. Deliverable : Updated version of your Design Space visualizing the socio-technical system of your project. Which elements can become part your decentralization strategy and how? Show paths of growth with new actors. Based on that create a draft roadmap for the next 5 years using a scalability matrix (columns are the years and files are the actions and actors involved). d. Task : Reflect on the following questions: How much do you own of your vision? What is important to keep close to you? Who should you involve to scale up? Create a scalability matrix (a roadmap for decentralization). 08/06 MDEFEST Preparation \u00b6 a. Goals : MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters\u2019 journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long. Co-curated with faculty Daniel Charny. b. Activity : Students will design a session for the fest which its main goal will be to involve the community that they have worked with & that they will like to work in the future. c. Deliverable : Planning of your session. d. Task : Pilot and run rehearsals of the sessions. Production, dissemination needs to be arranged at the same time. 14/06 - 25/06 MDEFEST \u00b6 a. Goals : MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters\u2019 journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long. Co-curated with faculty Daniel Charny. b. Activity : Sessions will last maximum half a day, can be digital or physical (with remote streaming), done individually or in groups (preferably) and can be in the format of a workshop, a debate, a visit, a meetup or any kind of format the students find suitable for this experience. c. Deliverable : Two-week time-frame to hold the sessions planned for the Fest. End of academic year deliverables: \u00b6 5-10 High-resolution photos of the results of your projected. Master Thesis - Chapters 0-12, adding this Term the following chapters: i. Chapter 8 : Final Intervention ii. Chapter 9 : Measuring Impact iii. Chapter 10 : Response-ability iv.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges. The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times. Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging. The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture. Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty. The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.","title":"Index"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/#academic-information-2021-22","text":"","title":"Academic Information 2021-22"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/#welcome-to-the-year-2021-22","text":"","title":"Welcome to the Year 2021-22"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/#the-design-for-emergent-futures-approach","text":"MDEF is both a theoretical and practical Master.

Track \u00b6 Reflection Faculty \u00b6 HOLON - Markel Cormenzana, Merce Rua When \u00b6 From the 22rd to the 25 th of November Syllabus & Schedule \u00b6 Every future scenario is built by detecting \u201cweak signals\u201d that set trends and point to certain directions, based on the analysis of the main change factors we can detect in the present. And the present for 2022 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities. The goal of this first Weak Signals in the Wild Week is to give the students a general overview of the signals and toolkit that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hyper-local and situated view of some of the possible vectors that the Atlas presents. Tuesday 23/11 - 3:00 to 7:00 pm CET \u00b6 Session 1: Framing - Seminar \u00b6 Genealogy of our practice Shaking the role of the designer Experimenting with the social body Intersecting interests, SDGs and communities Practice or Homework: In groups. Ecosystem mapping and finding fit. Introspective work: from ego to eco meditation. We will help the students land their practice and interests in different creative communities around the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Homework to be presented on 25/11. Wednesday 24/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET \u00b6 Session 2: Social Presencing Theory - Workshop - (location TBD) \u00b6 During this workshop, we will embody assemblages of both human and non-human actants for sensing underlying dynamics and locating opportunities for action. We will use \u201cplanetary wellbeing\u201d as a general framework and intentionality. Participatory ecosystems: Knowledge as a correlate and body and bodies as epistemological instruments. Exercise 4D Map. Visualization and direct exemplification of the generation of truth. Thursday 25/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET \u00b6 Session 3: Tooling - Workshop \u00b6 Reviewing task from 1 st day Mindset and ways of designing Entering the field and ethnographic perspective * The limits and sins of participation Practice or Homework: Prototyping from a design within stance and social learning Friday 26/11 - 9:00 am to 1:00 pm CET \u00b6 Session 4: Emergent Strategy - Workshop \u00b6 Theories of change. From strategic management to emergent strategy. Intervention portfolio approach to systems transformation. The role of experiments and non-traditional research outputs (NTRO) * Reflecting / Sketching your role(s) in the system. Setting an agenda and stewarding change. Practice: speculative exercise of targeted systems change and transitions over a generation. Along the second part of the course, the mentorship will be extended in order to facilitate groups acceding and designing within already existing communities in Barcelona.

From non-profit cooperatives, associations, and foundations transforming sectors such as housing or energy, to local SMEs exploring the circular economy, to programs of the United Nations working on eco-innovation or international corporations defining how sustainability fits companies of their size. We exist to help these organizations become the new normal through design. We work to align their organizational goals with the needs of the people they serve and their social and environmental context. From experiences to the ecosystem, we shape the everyday life of transitions. Merc\u00e8 Rua \u00b6 Merc\u00e8 Rua Farges is a researcher and design strategist at Holon.cat. With a multidisciplinary profile, at the crossroads between the social sciences, design, and the performing arts, she works to train and accompany organizations in their efforts to prosper by favoring a positive impact on society and the environment. Her passion is bringing people and teams together to bring out their collective intelligence and alignment to drive change.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources. When \u00b6 Every Monday Schedule \u00b6 03/10 Bootcamp Kick off - Pick your fight(s). \u00b6 Goals : Integrate personal and professional interests. Activity 1 : Pick your fight(s).

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown?

Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop) \u00b6 Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a \"forensic report\" of each artifact. Output: A written \"forensic report\". Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module. Output: A dataset Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop) \u00b6 Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing. Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows. Almost useless machines (Experience workshop) \u00b6 Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world. In the making, students will put into practice the fundamental stages of rapid prototyping in Fab Labs from building a mockup to integrating multiple digitally fabricated components into a working artifact.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The second term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master's program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical). When \u00b6 Tuesdays from 2 to 7 pm, every two weeks Schedule \u00b6 Tuesday 11/01 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Kick-off - Reframing by reflecting on your project so far \u00b6 Goals : Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals, and next steps. Activity : Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 1 st trimester. Objectives: To incorporate a series of tools and methodologies to navigate through complexity in a current continuously changing reality. Assignment : Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development and by means of comparing yourself and your current project to previous projects, situations you have been in, and other projective techniques that will be explained in class. Deliverable : An updated version of your design space with a 500-word text with a summary of your journey so far, contextualizing your new locality and community. Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1 st intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after). Tuesday 25/01 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - A 1PP Design intervention in context. Look for your peers and communities \u00b6 Goals : Understand better yourself as a design tool in contexts, learn how to properly document, analyze and make sense of a design action from a 1PP. Activity 1 : Briefly present in class a proposal for the 1 st intervention of the second trimester. Activity 2 : Plan your first design intervention of the term and map the actors and infrastructure you want to involve. Task : Carry out your 1 st design intervention from a 1PP (involving yourself in the context you want to work on). Deliverable 1 : Document the 1PP design intervention, analyze it, and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering. Deliverable 2 : Update your design space with the relations you have built. Tuesday 08/02 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Network of co-responsibility. (Co-)designing for emergent futures in the present. \u00b6 Goals : Reflect on your network of co-responsibility. Look for your peers and communities to get feedback from. Activity : Present your results from your 1PP design intervention. Reflect on your work based on Sergio\u2019s Future Talk and guidelines given in class. Activity 2 : Analyze and map the reach of what you are able to respond to. Decide which relations you need to be co-responsible for and which you can delegate.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The second term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master's program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical).","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/design_studio_term_2/#when","text":"Tuesdays from 2 to 7 pm, every two weeks","title":"When"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/design_studio_term_2/#schedule","text":"","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/design_studio_term_2/#tuesday-1101-200-to-7-pm-cet-kick-off-reframing-by-reflecting-on-your-project-so-far","text":"Goals : Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals, and next steps.

Her research focuses on emotional response, merging biomaterials with digital fabrication. Through textiles, she proposes the exploration of new habitable spaces, as sensorial and interactive experiences in order to ideate on better solutions of coexistence. To support and expand her exploratory nature, she is also researching on re-designing and upcycling organic food \u2018waste\u2019 turning it into objects, and facilitates talks and biomaterials workshops where she proposes the exploration of the organic matter as a contemporary artistic practice. Inspired by textile storytelling, she has got a degree in textile design and combined it with different courses of craft techniques. Later on during Fabricademy course at Fab Lab Barcelona, she learned about bio- design, digital manufacturing and wearable technology to develop smart and sustainable textiles.

Research has shown that most of the job opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next few years still don\u2019t exist. Instead of seeing it as a threat, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision, and identity rather than passively wait for what is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development especially in a master program full of activities. We want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to compare yourself with. In this series of talks, the critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses in relation to the approach to design that the master is proposing.

Research has shown that most of the job opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next few years still don\u2019t exist. Instead of seeing it as a threat, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision, and identity rather than passively wait for what is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development especially in a master program full of activities. We want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to compare yourself with. In this series of talks, the critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses in relation to the approach to design that the master is proposing. A series of presentations and visits to key professionals will make you aware of how your thinking, making, interests, and values differ from others.","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/future_talks_2021_22/#when","text":"Mondays, time TBD.","title":"When"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/future_talks_2021_22/#talks","text":"Monday 10/01 > Audrey Desjardines - Autobiographical Design - Approaching failure http://audreydesjardins.com/ Monday 24/01 > Laura Forlano - Auto-ethnography https://lauraforlano.org/ Monday 07/02 > Sergio Urue\u00f1a - Responsive Innovation https://es.linkedin.com/in/sergio-urue%C3%B1a-l%C3%B3pez-aa5a8944 Monday 21/02 > Sa\u00fal Baeza - Radical experimentation in design research https://www.does-work.com Visit Hospitalet creative district.","title":"Talks:"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_2_2021_22/future_talks_2021_22/#output","text":"At the end of this trimester we expect you to update who you are and what makes you unique (identity) and your personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional.

Using The Everything Manifesto as a meta-brief, participants will have the opportunity to learn how to use hypothetical questions to develop useful fiction stories about how everyday life can change in the next billion seconds, following methodologies where they can practice collective ideation, decision making, and other collaborative approaches. When \u00b6 Mondays, from 9 to 11 am. Schedule \u00b6 \u201cMeaning is a property of intelligence. If planet Earth is the only place with intelligence in the entire galaxy, then is on planet earth where meaning can only exist\u201d - Brian Cox. English physicist and former musician who is a professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester and The Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science. It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define is aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other people\u2019s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself. Finding meaning and purpose is a lifetime discovery, that could be perpetual and take many lives. For centuries, humans have been using different tools in order to expand their understanding of the world they could see, smell, touch, listen, and taste. Philosophy helped us ask questions that go beyond what our senses can detect and our brains can process. Religion provided answers to many existential questions by transposing the human power to higher beings or spirits. Science aims to respond to existential questions with hard facts, based on the scientific method of proposing theories and then prove them right. How one can navigate in such a complex configuration of belief systems, overlapping between each other, and still feel part of something? As designers, it is important to align our belief system with our actions and build meaningful connections with what we do, from simplicity (that can be transcendental) to complexity. We will not be able to respond definitive answers during this course, but we aim to expand the world\u2019s views of the course participants (students, tutors, guests) through fruitful debate and discussions. Course objective: \u00b6 One of the main goals of MDEF is to align students\u2019 purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities, in order to provide all the necessary means to become agents of change. In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students\u2019 decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters\u2019 projects. The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.

The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through a unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources. During this 6-month programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of MDEF version is to combine the concepts and practices of the Fab Academy program with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects. A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological \u2018black boxes\u2019 to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures. Methodology \u00b6 The program applies FabAcademy mindset without modifying the global schedule, but applying new methodologies such as \"rotational task's stations\", redistributing the impact of weekly hours and adding new assessment criteria. The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d. Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrates the competencies acquired.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analysing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first and second term of the Master program (research and design). After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on designing an improved intervention in the real world (digital or physical). Special efforts will be geared towards the development of projects in the context of the current global pandemic, and how such interventions take place in new contexts (domestic, digital, new locations), while contributing to the previous work in tems one and two, and continue building the project\u2019s vision for desirable futures.. The Design Studio time will be dedicated to supporting the students to adapt their work in the current special global context, develop their final design intervention in new spaces, and communicate their project to build new narratives, taking into account the current \u201cnew normal\u201d. During the studio, studio leaders will bring invited guests to introduce topics of interest to the process and to participate in tutorials during the desk crits. Deliverables \u00b6 At the end of this trimester we expect you to update who you are and what makes you unique (identity) and your personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional. Create a specific post on your website. Total Duration \u00b6 Weekly studio days will be every Tuesday from 14:30hrs to 17:30hrs. Structure and Phases \u00b6 __Apr 16 - Kick off - My new me \u00b6 Activities : Reflect on how the new normal is shaping you personally. Explore and document a day in your life with notes, photos, videos, self-interviews\u2026 Deliverable : One post with some visuals (photo, video, graphics, moodboard,\u2026). A short reflection in a 2-3 minute video, following the \u201cyoutuber\u201d model.. __Apr 21 - Mapping my domestic experimental laboratory \u00b6 Activities : Accept and reflect on how the new normal is shaping you as a professional. Rethinking your new hyper-local and hyper-connected design space. Goals : Being resilient and resourceful as a professional. Deliverable : One post with a new design space including what infrastructure, people, things and materials became available either physical or virtual in this new normal. __Apr 28 - Experimenting with my project in emergent contexts \u00b6 Activities : Looking for new meaningful actions, being resilient and resourceful. Goals : Piloting a new intervention with yourself or close connections. Deliverable : one post documenting your design actions with new normal design space and resources. Plan for your design intervention (after piloting yourself). __May 5 - Collaborating with others for my project in new spaces \u00b6 Activities : Relating 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd person perspectives in a hyper-local and hyper-connected context. Goals : Create a new intervention in this new normal. Deliverable : one post with documenting your design intervention. A distributed, online collective design action. __May 12 - Creating your own biography and constituency \u00b6 Activities : From a post-human design perspective explore your evolution (you and your context) from before and during the master. Goals : Understand who you are and what you are capable of. Deliverable : one post with visualizing own biography and constituency. Include a short reflection for each one. __May 19 - Reflecting about new weak signals in your future scenario \u00b6 Activities : Any transformation needs to occur now already taking into account the future new normal scenario you want to achieve not the given one. Goals : Reflection on two previous experiments and analyze the opportunities for reframing the future new normal that you want to achieve. Deliverable : one post with new weak signals describing how the present opportunities for your project you haven\u2019t explored before shape your future new normal. scenario __May 26 - Emerging Narratives \u00b6 Activities : Outlining a clear vision for your project. Defining clear intentions and developing a clear identity. Goals : Distilling the mission and vision of your project. Deliverable : A communication strategy for your project. __June 2 - Looking forward \u00b6 Activities : From Hyper-Local to Hyper-Global - Outlining strategies to reach interconnected global scales. Goals : Reflection on the scalability of the project to other contexts. Deliverable : A professional development plan for after this year of the master. __June 9 - Closing the Loop \u00b6 Activities : Draft set up for the \u201cexhibition/book/event\u201d.

The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through a unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources. During this 6-month programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. When \u00b6 Wednesdays + one full week every four weeks Schedule \u00b6 Global Class \u00b6 These classes are given by Neil Gershenfeld, broadcasted every Wednesday from 9:00 am \u2013 12:00 pm EST (3:00 PM Barcelona Time ). The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. Local Classes \u00b6 These classes are given every Wednesday from 10 Am to 13.00 Pm (CET time) Lab life \u00b6 In addition to the lectures, there are 2 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects. Fabrication time previous booking system. Expert Support \u00b6 Timeframe open to book appointments on specific subjects or expertise. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of MDEF version is to combine the concepts and practices of the Fab Academy program with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects. A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological \u2018black boxes\u2019 to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures. Methodology \u00b6 The program applies FabAcademy mindset without modifying the global schedule, but applying new methodologies such as \"rotational task's stations\" , redistributing the impact of weekly hours and adding new assessment criteria. The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d . Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrate the competencies acquired.","title":"MDEF Academy - Fab Academy"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_3_2021_22/fab_academy_term_3_2021_22/#structure-of-2021-22","text":"","title":"Structure of 2021-22"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_3_2021_22/fab_academy_term_3_2021_22/#fab-academy","text":"","title":"Fab Academy"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_3_2021_22/fab_academy_term_3_2021_22/#track","text":"Application","title":"Track"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_3_2021_22/fab_academy_term_3_2021_22/#faculty","text":"Santi Fuentemilla, Eduardo Chamorro, Josep Mart\u00ed, Daphne Gerodimou, \u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez, Victor Barber\u00e1n","title":"Faculty"},{"location":"previous_years/academic_year_2021_22/term_3_2021_22/fab_academy_term_3_2021_22/#syllabus","text":"The Fab Academy is a distributed educational model directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT\u2019s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT\u2019s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything .
