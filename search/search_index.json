Evolving from an utilitarian perspective at the service of industry (design over) to the integration of the perspective of the human user and it\u2019s needs (design for) and, later on, it\u2019s integration as an active agent in the design process (design with) the agency and expertise of the designer has been critically put into question generation after generation. Presencing the burst of the user-centered bubble and in the face of various existential risks, along these sessions, we will inquire over our role as designers and experience what it means to design within creative communities with the goal of putting our personal projects and capacities at the service of deep transitions. Community engagement in practice - learning from Fab Lab Barcelona\u2019s projects \u00b6 Syllabus and Learning Objectives \u00b6 Those promoting participatory action-research believe that people have a universal right to participate in the production of knowledge which is a disciplined process of personal and social transformation. In this process, people rupture their existing attitudes of silence, accommodation and passivity, and gain confidence and abilities to alter unjust conditions and structures'. (Paulo Freire, in Smith et al, 1997:xi) Fab Lab Barcelona has been involved in many European and local action-research projects with the goal of developing, testing, and implementing alternative and circular strategies towards a (more) locally productive and globally connected city. In the practical sections of the Community Engagement seminar, MDEF students will be invited to explore methodologies and tools of two community-based local pilots led by Fab Lab Barcelona. The local pilots connected to the SISCODE and CENTRINNO EU projects, while differing in specific objectives and goals, have been aligned with the Fab City principles and share a common objective: both expand the purpose of creative spaces and practitioners to transform communities, societies and ecosystems, supporting the development of new approaches to innovation, learning and impact at the local level, while articulating global efforts. Within the context of the above-mentioned projects, during the two sessions, students will practice with methods to support social change whilst focussing down on the purpose of engagement. By learning and understanding the application of tailored tools and their practical uses, students will have access to knowledge and resources to use in their future projects. The pool of tools ranges from enabling actions to map actors and resources, analysing local contexts, identifying potential synergies and opportunities, and amplifying key benefits for local stakeholders. The practical course will be further enriched with thematic topics addressing circular and collaborative manufacturing, co-creation mechanisms, practice-based capacity building and peer-learning. During the two days of activities, students will also have the opportunity to visit and engage with four local community-driven projects in Poblenou. The visits will take place from 5pm to 7pm on November 22 nd and 24 th (TBC) and are aimed at learning about the projects\u2019 stories and achievements, their innovative strategies and approaches to inclusive and circular ecosystems.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources.","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/design_studio_framing_design_interventions_2022_23/#when","text":"Every Monday","title":"When"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/design_studio_framing_design_interventions_2022_23/#schedule","text":"","title":"Schedule"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/design_studio_framing_design_interventions_2022_23/#0310-bootcamp-kick-off-pick-your-fights","text":"Goals : Integrate personal and professional interests.

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown? Andersen was based at STEIM for 14 years, she was part of the Making Things Public art research program at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and lead the Instruments and Interfaces master\u2019s degree program at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague. She is a longstanding advisor of the Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie, and currently acts as expert reviewer for H2020, ICT and FET for both application and project reviews.

Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world. Is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication, physical computing and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience for rapid prototyping. Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition. We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an \u201chonest\u201d mechanical artifact. Total Duration \u00b6 The course duration is a total of 32 hours of guided workshop time, spanned along two weeks. The guided workshop time will happen Tuesday to Friday and the students are committed to work during the afternoon in the projects on a self-guided methodology Classes: \u00b6 from 10:00 to 14:00 (16 per week) Hands-on sessions guided by instructors Group work: \u00b6 from 15:00 to 19:00 (16 per week) Non guided sessions where students work on a task independently or in groups Structure and Phases \u00b6 Class by class schedule of topics and activities.

Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop) \u00b6 Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a \"forensic report\" of each artifact. Output: A written \"forensic report\". Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module. Output: A dataset Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop) \u00b6 Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing. Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows. Almost useless machines (Experience workshop) \u00b6 Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world. In the making, students will put into practice the fundamental stages of rapid prototyping in Fab Labs from building a mockup to integrating multiple digitally fabricated components into a working artifact. Output: A useless machine https://hackmd.io/@fablabbcn/BJA1L3PDK","title":"Tech Beyond The Myth"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/tech_beyond_the_myth_2022_23/#structure-of-2022-23","text":"","title":"Structure of 2022-23"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/tech_beyond_the_myth_2022_23/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/tech_beyond_the_myth_2022_23/#track","text":"Instrumentation","title":"Track"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/tech_beyond_the_myth_2022_23/#faculty","text":"Santi Fuentemilla, Eduardo Chamorro, Josep Mart\u00ed, Guillem Camprodon, \u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez, Victor Barber\u00e1n","title":"Faculty"},{"location":"academic_year_2022_23/term_1_2022_23/tech_beyond_the_myth_2022_23/#syllabus","text":"We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who\u2019s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design.

By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a \"forensic report\" of each artifact. Output: A written \"forensic report\". Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption.

The introduction of those processes into the design and industry fields are changing the paradigm on how we conceive the actual society and its production methods. This new mediation between the old knowledge and new techniques is making the process as important as the end work, all becoming a whole. During this 2 term course (2&3), students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through an unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources. Weekly Schedule \u00b6 Master Classes: \u00b6 This classes are given every two weeks on Wednesday and Thursdays from 10 Am to 13.00 Pm (CET time) for two weeks in a row. Lab life: \u00b6 In addition to the lectures, there are 2 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.Fabrication time through booking system,this happens every Tuesday and Friday Challenge week: \u00b6 Intensive timeframe for a week (Tuesday to Friday) where students will combine the knowledge gained in the previous classes. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of DIGITAL PROTOTYPING FOR DESIGN is to combine the concepts and practices of digital fabrication & prototyping electronices with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects. A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological \u2018black boxes\u2019 to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures.

The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d . Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrating the competencies acquired. The challenges combine four weekly cycles into one intense project-based fabrication sprint. Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students. As mentioned before, the intention is to weave the two courses together in order to enhance both for the benefit of the students\u2019 projects. The design studio provides a critical context in relation to the technologies developed during Fab Academy, and in return the Fab Academy course yields the skills and knowledge to help physicalize these concepts. Materials Needs \u00b6 All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the classes. Bring in your laptop with the proper software installed prior to the class if required (emails will be sent prior to the classes regarding this aspect). Output \u00b6 Each student builds a portfolio on their respective websites that documents their mastery of different certificates taken individually along each week and their integration into a final, larger project, related to their masters thesis development. The DESIGN FOR PROTOTYPING COURSE is PASSED by growth progress rather than a global goal, for successful completion of each weekly assignment and challenge is a must. Grading Method \u00b6 The student will be reviewed by turns weekly on their weekly tasks, on Wednesday from 3:00PM to 4:30PM.Where they will have feedback and guidance for their final master project prototype. Only the documentation into their webpages will be taken in account for evaluation The weekly standards and grading will be presented in each weekly assignment. During the master class.

Faculty \u00b6 Oscar Tomico & Mariana Quintero Syllabus \u00b6 Future Talks is a series of conversations with friends of ELISAVA and Fab Lab Barcelona, exploring the nature of emerging futures from the past to the present and beyond. Research has shown that most of the job opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next few years still don\u2019t exist. Instead of seeing it as a threat, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development especially in a master program full of activities. We want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with.

Research has shown that most of the job opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next few years still don\u2019t exist. Instead of seeing it as a threat, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what is needed. In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development especially in a master program full of activities. We want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with.

If planet Earth is the only place with intelligence in the entire galaxy, then is on planet earth where meaning can only exist\u201d - Brian Cox. English physicist and former musician who is a professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester and The Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science. It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define is aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other people\u2019s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself. Finding meaning and purpose is a lifetime discovery, that could be perpetual and take many lives. For centuries, humans have been using different tools in order to expand their understanding of the world they could see, smell, touch, listen, and taste. Philosophy helped us ask questions that go beyond what our senses can detect and our brains can process. Religion provided answers to many existential questions by transposing the human power to higher beings or spirits. Science aims to respond to existential questions with hard facts, based on the scientific method of proposing theories and then prove them right. How one can navigate in such a complex configuration of belief systems, overlapping between each other, and still feel part of something? As designers, it is important to align our belief system with our actions and build meaningful connections with what we do, from simplicity (that can be transcendental) to complexity. We will not be able to respond definitive answers during this course, but we aim to expand the world\u2019s views of the course participants (students, tutors, guests) through fruitful debate and discussions. When \u00b6 Tuesday, from 9 to 11 am. Where \u00b6 Online. Calendar \u00b6 January 17: Course introduction, discussion on papers, and content of the seminar. January 31: Conversation with a guest speaker.

Conversations with*: \u00b6 Primavera de Filippi Stephanie Hankey Mattia Bernini Yu Li Sename Koffee Beno Juarez Marcela Sabino Sudebi Thakurata *Based on availability and calendar. Not all participants listed will be part of the course\u2019s program. Course objective \u00b6 One of the main goals of MDEF is to align students\u2019 purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities, in order to provide all the necessary means to become agents of change. In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students\u2019 decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters\u2019 projects. The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.

And the present for 2022 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities. The goal of this first Weak Signals in the Wild Week is to give the students a general overview of the signals and toolkit that constitute the ongoing Atlas, a showcase of the research projects developed by former students and research faculty, and finally, a glimpse into a specific context which offers a hyper-local and situated view of some of the possible vectors that the Atlas presents.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. The specific goals are the following: To develop a critical position in the student\u2019s design practice. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals. Prototype an alpha version of the design space and iterate. To build personal and collective repositories of resources. When \u00b6 Every Monday Schedule \u00b6 03/10 Bootcamp Kick off - Pick your fight(s). \u00b6 Goals : Integrate personal and professional interests. Activity 1 : Pick your fight(s).

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown? Andersen was based at STEIM for 14 years, she was part of the Making Things Public art research program at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and lead the Instruments and Interfaces master\u2019s degree program at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague. She is a longstanding advisor of the Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie, and currently acts as expert reviewer for H2020, ICT and FET for both application and project reviews. Andersen co-chaired the CHI art 2018, CHI Design paper track 2019 and 2020, and DIS pictorials 2019.

She currently works at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), teaching Design Processes for the Masters Digital Design (MSc.) program, as well as doing research with the Play and Civic Media research group. She is also a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie doctoral fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology and Philips Lighting Research. For over a decade her practise as a designer has investigated wearable technologies in art, research and commercial contexts. She has designed functional garments in a wide range of industries, from medical to commercial space flight, and lectures on the design challenges of integrating electronics into fashion. Most notably, she founded Vega Wearable Light, a line of illuminated outerwear for style-conscious cyclists from 2010-2014. Mackey's doctoral research focuses on explorations of digital materials combined with fashion and everyday clothing-wearing practices as a means of gaining insight into future smart-garment systems.

Her work is concerned with how we can allow each other to imagine our possible technological futures through digital craftsmanship and collaborations with semi intelligent machines in the context of material practices of soft fiber-based things. How can we innovate, design and act around that which is yet to be imagined? Who gets to drive innovation processes? And how can we reframe our methodologies to include the complex cultural, political, and personal aspects of life? Can we approach this through making (and thinking) about technology, communities and materials as a way to construct visions of the unknown? Andersen was based at STEIM for 14 years, she was part of the Making Things Public art research program at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and lead the Instruments and Interfaces master\u2019s degree program at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague.

Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop) \u00b6 Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a \"forensic report\" of each artifact. Output: A written \"forensic report\". Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module. Output: A dataset Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop) \u00b6 Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing. Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows. Almost useless machines (Experience workshop) \u00b6 Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world.

Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least an ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, a crisis of neoliberalism as the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years, multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, a crisis of the discourses that grew with the digital utopias, a crisis of the productive model and the nature of work, a crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business, and last but not least, a migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply.

Towards the end of the 21 st century, these include at least an ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, a crisis of neoliberalism as the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years, multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, a crisis of the discourses that grew with the digital utopias, a crisis of the productive model and the nature of work, a crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business, and last but not least, a migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply.

The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows: TERM 1 Research : Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. TERM 2 Design : Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world. TERM 3 Development : Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design. The second term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master's program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical).

Using The Everything Manifesto as a meta-brief, participants will have the opportunity to learn how to use hypothetical questions to develop useful fiction stories about how everyday life can change in the next billion seconds, following methodologies where they can practice collective ideation, decision making, and other collaborative approaches. When \u00b6 From 11 th to 14 th of January Schedule \u00b6 The course will follow a week-long studio format, divided into 4 sessions.

If planet Earth is the only place with intelligence in the entire galaxy, then is on planet earth where meaning can only exist\u201d - Brian Cox. English physicist and former musician who is a professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester and The Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science. It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define is aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other people\u2019s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself. Finding meaning and purpose is a lifetime discovery, that could be perpetual and take many lives. For centuries, humans have been using different tools in order to expand their understanding of the world they could see, smell, touch, listen, and taste. Philosophy helped us ask questions that go beyond what our senses can detect and our brains can process. Religion provided answers to many existential questions by transposing the human power to higher beings or spirits. Science aims to respond to existential questions with hard facts, based on the scientific method of proposing theories and then prove them right. How one can navigate in such a complex configuration of belief systems, overlapping between each other, and still feel part of something? As designers, it is important to align our belief system with our actions and build meaningful connections with what we do, from simplicity (that can be transcendental) to complexity. We will not be able to respond definitive answers during this course, but we aim to expand the world\u2019s views of the course participants (students, tutors, guests) through fruitful debate and discussions. Course objective: \u00b6 One of the main goals of MDEF is to align students\u2019 purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities, in order to provide all the necessary means to become agents of change. In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students\u2019 decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters\u2019 projects. The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.

The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through a unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources. During this 6-month programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of MDEF version is to combine the concepts and practices of the Fab Academy program with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects. A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological \u2018black boxes\u2019 to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures. Methodology \u00b6 The program applies FabAcademy mindset without modifying the global schedule, but applying new methodologies such as \"rotational task's stations\", redistributing the impact of weekly hours and adding new assessment criteria. The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of \u201cmicro-challenges\u201d. Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrates the competencies acquired. Schedule: \u00b6 Global Class : These classes are given by Neil Gershenfeld, broadcasted every Wednesday at 9:00 am \u2013 12:00 pm EST (3:00 PM Barcelona Time ). The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. Local Classes : This classes are given every Wednesday from 10 Am to 13.00 Pm (CET time) Lab life : In addition to the lectures, there are 2 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.
